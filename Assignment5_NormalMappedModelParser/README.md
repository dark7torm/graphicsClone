# Your Information

**Please edit the check box below(By placing an 'x' in the markdown) to help indicate to me if you completed all of A5 or just the shader in the starter code**

- [x] - I completed only the starter code shaders for up to 95% of the assignment.
- [ ] - I completed the .obj model (and/or the starter code)

* Core is the material everyone can get through. I expect everyone to complete this. Coming to class, listening to lectures, and reviewing materials should be sufficient.
* Intermediate is a little more difficult. Very likely you will have to utilize office hours, piazza, etc.
* Advanced is more challenging. You will have to spend more time and very likely use outside materials. I do not expect everyone to complete the advanced section.
