Debugging

Edit the following lines to list two things you learned about debugging (a command, a technique, a concept. etc.). This is a "for-credit" exercise, I will not evaluate what I consider "difficult enough", I just want to know you learned or practiced two things about debugging.

1. Being able to debug in the ide without an official "debugger" is really neat (official as in has a debug button)
2. It's cool that there is a manual with all of the commands that I can use with the debugger.
